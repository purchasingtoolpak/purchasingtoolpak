# Purchasing Toolpak
Purchasing Toolpak provides tools and templates for professional buyers. The templates help buyers improve productivity as they develop sourcing strategies, collaborate with suppliers and complete transactional activities.

### Use Excel and Word Templates

The templates are compatible with Microsoft Office Excel and Word. In addition the templates are also compatible with Pages and Numbers for Mac and IOS, Google Docs and Sheets and Apache Open Office. Any templates using macros will only work with Excel for Windows. MicrosoftÂ® and the Office logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States
and/or other countries.

### Some of the most popular templates

Some of the most popular templates and tools are:

* **Purchase Order** - The purchase order template provides the information needed to order parts or services. There are two purchase order templates; one for ordering parts and a second for the purchase of services. 
* **Bid Evaluation** - Quickly evaluate bids from multiple suppliers. After entering description, quantity and price for each supplier, the bid evaluation template does the rest of the work!
* **Request for Quotation** - Utilize this template to request suppliers to submit bids for materials, services
or equipment.
* **Supplier Profile Form** - Use the supplier profile form to help assess a supplier's capabilities. Assess the profile to determine if the supplier(s) are capable to participate in the competitive bid process. Use the form to screen new or innovative suppliers prior to technical review by R&D or Engineering.
* **Contract Approval** - In many organizations procurement policy requires management approval of contracts. Use this template for approval of procurement contracts.
