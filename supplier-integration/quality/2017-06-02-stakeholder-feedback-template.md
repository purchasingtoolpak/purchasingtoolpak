Here is a screenshot of the procurement stakeholder feedback template:

</div>

There are four columns is the stakeholder feedback template:

1. **Stakeholder Feedback** - state both formal and informal feedback regarding issues and opportunities for improvement.
2. **Restatement of Problem** - procurement uses root cause analysis to restate understanding of the underlying issues.
3. **Resolution to the Problem** - list action steps that will resolve stakeholder issues and concerns.
4. **Measure of Progress** - state direct quantifiable metrics to measure action plans.

I would recommend that procurement track stakeholder feedback on a department-wide basis. For example, a department with 10 buyers may be working on 30 stakeholder-driven projects. This information could be incorporated into the overall department metrics.

Using lean six sigma would be a preferred approach for complex projects. The DMAIC method (design, measure, analyze, improve, control) is a proven method yielding great results.
